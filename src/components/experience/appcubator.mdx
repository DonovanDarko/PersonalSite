Appcubator is the easiest way to prototype. Its goal is to allow non-technical
founders to create and deploy working MVPs using a simple drag-n-drop interface.
Unlike other no-code / low-code solutions at the time, we allowed users to
export fully readable code and continue developing their apps with their own
developers.

In 2012, I was invited by my friends Karan Sikka and Ilter Canberk to join their
startup as a founding engineer. Appcubator had just participated in the
[YC W13](https://www.ycdb.co/company/appcubator) batch and was one of the
earliest low-code solutions to hit the market. My job was to develop the plugin
editor our team used to create and integrate functionality into applications.
This allowed our users to quickly extend their app with 3rd party integrations
and standard recipes.

After a magnificent journey, our team decided to phase out operations and
[open-source our code](https://github.com/appcubator/appbuild) in 2014. Working
on Appcubator was one of the most formative experiences of my career. With
Appcubator, I learned how to work with clients, ship on tight deadlines, and
make the difficult tradeoffs between cost, speed, and quality critical in a
business environment.
