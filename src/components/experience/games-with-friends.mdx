As part of the Advanced Technology and Growth Team at Zynga, one of my jobs was
to build games and core tech for emerging platforms. At the time, Apple had just
[released Apps for iMessage](https://9to5mac.com/2016/09/12/disney-imessage-app-store-stickers-ios-10/),
and Facebook was
[launching Instant Games](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/messenger-instant-games/).
With over 65% of users' mobile time spent in messaging apps, it was the perfect
opportunity to inject fun into our players' everyday conversations.

Throughout 2016, I build client libraries and APIs that were used in over 8
Zynga games. I also integrated Messenger APIs into Zynga's Instant Games,
allowing our designers and PMs to easily send rich texts to reactivate our
players. During this time, I gained invaluable experience in database operation,
systems design, and product management from an engineer's perspective.
