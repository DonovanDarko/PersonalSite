Street Jumper is a hyperlocal delivery startup based in Jaipur, Rajasthan.
Between 2014 and 2016, we offered a point-to-point delivery service in the city.
In 2014, my classmate Tarin asked me to join his company Street Jumper to help
him build out and enhance the platform's technology. For one year, I worked with
our team of engineers and designers to develop and improve web, iOS, and Android
applications used by our customers and delivery partners. At our peak, we
employed 50 delivery partners and processed 250-300 orders per day. In 2016,
Street Jumper was
[acquired by Mumbai based investor and entrepreneur Sandip Modi.](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/121593-88#overview).

Building Street Jumper was a foundational experience for me, and I'm incredibly
thankful to my co-founder, Tarin. I learned how a focus on privacy and security
can transform an operations-intensive user experience. I also gained valuable
experience fundraising in highly competitive capital markets in India.
