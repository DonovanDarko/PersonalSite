In 2019 I decided to start a consulting business. My first contract was with
[ZeroDown](https://zerodown.com), an innovative real estate platform based out
of San Francisco. The founders had just completed raising a Series A after going
through YCombinator's W19 batch. ZeroDown's mission
["to create a new path to homeownership"](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/zero-down/)
felt personal as homeownership always felt out of reach in cities like Vancouver
and San Francisco.

ZeroDown is driven by the radical idea that professionals with steady jobs and
healthy finances should be able to afford homes - even in San Francisco. Thir
unique model offers an alternative to the rent-or-own dilemma, giving users the
benefits of homeownership with the flexibility of renting.

I worked with the engineering and product teams to rebuild zerodown.com. I
planned and implemented a phased transition to a modern component-based
architecture to increase site performance and engineering productivity. I also
helped launch the
[Quantitative Home Buying Guide for San Francisco](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/quantitative-home-buying-guide-bay-area),
which used data to help homebuyers find their ideal neighborhood.

I implemented best practices to enhance web performance, SEO, social presence. I
also evaluated and integrated various 3rd-party offerings to enrich user
data,enhancee analytical insights and streamline sales processes. I collaborated
with the marketing and product team to conduct experiments and drive decisions
for new products and campaigns. At ZeroDown I learned how data transparency can
transform decision making for individuals and build an organization's
reputation.
