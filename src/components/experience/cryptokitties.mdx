In late 2017, Dapper Labs released the first breedable crypto-collectible token
for the Ethereum blockchain. Within days, it had become the most popular
Ethereum smart contract and began making headlines in the world of
cryptocurrencies and beyond. As an early investor in Ethereum, I became
fascinated with this new class of assets and began
[doing my research into this new trading game](https://hackernoon.com/hacking-the-cryptokitties-genome-1cb3e7dddab3).

I soon realized the decentralized nature of this game opened up many
possibilities for
[permissionless innovation](https://medium.com/coinmonks/permissionless-innovation-on-ethereum-f6264b9a8391).
I wrote the
[KittyHats whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eDfZr-MfXnjwk2W7q00z-CnseGfqSpoHIyIHCHCjSAQ/edit#heading=h.2wcq9nxi3nbj)
and, over the next few months designed, built and launched the extension that
allowed users to dress and accessorize their CryptoKitties. CryptoKitties' users
began buying our accessories and even made some of their own using our
technology. We facilitated several productive collaborations including one with
the Seattle Children's hospital
[where we raised over 21 ETH to help sick children](https://giveto.seattlechildrens.org/page.aspx?pid=641&tab=0&frsid=690).

Soon, the
[CryptoKitties team took notice](https://medium.com/cryptokitties/welcome-to-the-kittyverse-kittybattles-and-kittyhats-9e83bb1ded88)
of our project and acquired KittyHats. I came to work for Dapper Labs in Canada.
During my time there, I worked on building features for CryptoKitties as well as
working on new crypto collectible concepts like
[Cheeze Wizards](https://medium.com/dapperlabs/cheeze-wizards-the-worlds-first-blockchain-battle-royale-with-cheese-756ec102f9ab),
[NBA Top Shot](https://www.nbatopshot.com/) and others. Through my work at
Dapper Labs, I learned how to leverage the strengths and limitations of digital
ledger technologies to create unique and memorable user experiences.
