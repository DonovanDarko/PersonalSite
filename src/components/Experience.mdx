Appcubator is the easiest way to prototype. It's goal is to allow non-technical
founders to create and deploy working MVPs using a simple drag-n-drop interface.
Unlike other no-code / low-code solutions at the time, we allowed users to
export fully readably code and continue developing their apps with their own
developers.

In 2012, I was invited by my friends Karan Sikka and Ilter Canberk to join their
startup as a founding engineer. Appcubator had just participated in the
[YC W13](https://www.ycdb.co/company/appcubator) batch and was one of the
earliest low-code solutions to hit the market. My job was to develop the plugin
editor our team used to create and integrate functionality into applications.
This allowed our users quickly extend their app with 3rd party integrations and
common recipes.

In 2014 our team decided to phase out operations and open-source our code.
Working on Appcubator was one of the most formative experiences of my career.
With Appcubator, I learned how to work clients, work on tight deadlines and made
difficult tradeoffs.

### Street Jumper

##### Hyperlocal delivery service

Street Jumper is a hyperlocal delivery startup based in Jaipur, Rajasthan.
Between 2014 and 2016, we offered a point-to-point delivery service in the city
In 2014, my classmate Tarin asked me join his company Street Jumper to help him
build out and enhance the technology behind the platform. Over a period of one
year, I worked with our team of engineers and designers to develop and enhance
web, iOS and Android applications for users and delivery partners. At our peak,
we employed 50 delivery partners and processed 250-300 orders per day. In 2016,
Street Jumper was acquired by Mumbai based investor and entrepreneur Sandip
Modi.

Building Street Jumper was a foundational experience for me and I'm extremely
thankful to my co-founder for the journey. I learned how a focus on privacy and
security can transform an operations-intensive user experience. I also gained
experience operating in a highly competitive Indian market.

As part of the Growth Team at Zynga, one of my jobs was to build games and core
tech for emerging platforms. At the time, Apple had just released Apps for
iMessage and Facebook was in the process of launching Instant Games.

During this time, I got to build client libraries and APIs that were used in
over 8 games. I also integrated Messenger APIs into Zynga's launch titles for
Instant Games allowing our designers and PMs to easily send rich texts over
Messenger to reactivate our players.

In 2018 I joined the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh as lead developer for the
Innovation Studio.

Having secured funding from the Knight Foundation, our goal was to create a
chatbot that museum guests could engage with inside and outside the museum. We
partnered with ACE to digitize the Summer Adventure program and open it up for
our visitors
