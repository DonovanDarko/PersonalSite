Appcubator is the easiest way to prototype. Its goal is to allow non-technical
founders to create and deploy working MVPs using a simple drag-n-drop interface.
Unlike other no-code / low-code solutions at the time, we allowed users to
export fully readable code and continue developing their apps with their own
developers.

In 2012, I was invited by my friends Karan Sikka and Ilter Canberk to join their
startup as a founding engineer. Appcubator had just participated in the
[YC W13](https://www.ycdb.co/company/appcubator) batch and was one of the
earliest low-code solutions to hit the market. My job was to develop the plugin
editor our team used to create and integrate functionality into applications.
This allowed our users to quickly extend their app with 3rd party integrations
and standard recipes.

After a magnificent journey, our team decided to phase out operations and
[open-source our code](https://github.com/appcubator/appbuild) in 2014. Working
on Appcubator was one of the most formative experiences of my career. With
Appcubator, I learned how to work with clients, ship on tight deadlines, and
make difficult tradeoffs between cost, speed, and quality critical to business
operations.

Street Jumper is a hyperlocal delivery startup based in Jaipur, Rajasthan.
Between 2014 and 2016, we offered a point-to-point delivery service in the city.
In 2014, my classmate Tarin asked me to join his company Street Jumper to help
him build out and enhance the platform's technology. For one year, I worked with
our team of engineers and designers to develop and improve web, iOS, and Android
applications used by our customers and delivery partners. At our peak, we
employed 50 delivery partners and processed 250-300 orders per day. In 2016,
Street Jumper was
[acquired by Mumbai based investor and entrepreneur Sandip Modi.](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:AjJa8-lD5WQJ:https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/38842-38842/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us).

Building Street Jumper was a foundational experience for me, and I'm incredibly
thankful to my co-founder, Tarin. I learned how a focus on privacy and security
can transform an operations-intensive user experience. I also gained valuable
experience fundraising in highly competitive capital markets in India.

As part of the Advanced Technology and Growth Team at Zynga, one of my jobs was
to build games and core tech for emerging platforms. At the time, Apple had just
[released Apps for iMessage](https://9to5mac.com/2016/09/12/disney-imessage-app-store-stickers-ios-10/),
and Facebook was
[launching Instant Games](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/messenger-instant-games/).
With over 65% of users' mobile time spent in messaging apps, it was the perfect
opportunity to inject fun into our players' everyday conversations.

<div className='w-full flex justify-center items-center'>

![fixed.640px.380px](/images/resume/gameswithfriends.webp)

</div>

Throughout 2016, I build client libraries and APIs that were used in over 8
Zynga games. I also integrated Messenger APIs into Zynga's Instant Games,
allowing our designers and PMs to easily send rich texts to reactivate our
players. During this time, I gained invaluable experience in database operation,
systems design, and product management from an engineer's perspective.

##### Summer Adventure with a digital Carnegie

In 2018 I joined the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh as lead developer for the
Innovation Studio. Having secured a USD 150,000
[grant from the Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/museums-technology-new-avenues-for-wonder/),
our goal was to create a chatbot that museum guests could engage with inside and
outside the museum. We partnered with Advancement and Community Engagement (ACE)
team to digitize their existing Summer Adventure program and open it up for all
our visitors. You can read more about CarnegieBot in this
[blog post](https://studio.carnegiemuseums.org/a-chatbot-adventure-c729812571ea).

<div className='w-full flex justify-center items-center'>

</div>

Over the next 8 months, we developed an
[open-source Messenger chatbot](https://github.com/achadha235/andybot-botpress)
that allowed users to engage in digital activities across all 4 of our museum
properties. Through the program, we discovered the chatbot dramatically
increased membership signup, engagement, and retention. In May 2018, we
[presented our findings at the American Alliance of Museums](https://www.aam-us.org/2018/04/10/chat-with-andybot-at-aam-2018/).

### CryptoKitties

##### Provably scarce kitties on the blockchain

In late 2017, Dapper Labs released the first breedable crypto-collectible token
for the Ethereum blockchain. Within days, it had become the most popular
Ethereum smart contract and began making headlines in the world of
cryptocurrencies and beyond. As an early investor in Ethereum, I became
fascinated with this new class of assets and began
[doing my research into this new trading game](https://hackernoon.com/hacking-the-cryptokitties-genome-1cb3e7dddab3).

I soon realized the decentralized nature of this game opened up many
possibilities for
[permissionless innovation](https://medium.com/coinmonks/permissionless-innovation-on-ethereum-f6264b9a8391).
I wrote the
[KittyHats whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eDfZr-MfXnjwk2W7q00z-CnseGfqSpoHIyIHCHCjSAQ/edit#heading=h.2wcq9nxi3nbj)
and, over the next few months designed, built and launched the extension that
allowed users to dress and accessorize their CryptoKitties. CryptoKitties began
using our accessories and even made some of their own. W e facilitated several
productive collaborations including one with the Seattle Children's hospital
[where we raised over 21 ETH to help sick children](https://giveto.seattlechildrens.org/page.aspx?pid=641&tab=0&frsid=690).

Soon, the
[CryptoKitties team took notice](https://medium.com/cryptokitties/welcome-to-the-kittyverse-kittybattles-and-kittyhats-9e83bb1ded88)
of our project and acquired KittyHats. I came to work for Dapper Labs in Canada.
During my time there, I worked on building features for CryptoKitties as well as
working on new crypto collectible concepts like
[Cheeze Wizards](https://medium.com/dapperlabs/cheeze-wizards-the-worlds-first-blockchain-battle-royale-with-cheese-756ec102f9ab),
[NBA Top Shot](https://www.nbatopshot.com/) and others. Through my work at
Dapper Labs, I learned how to leverage the strengths and limitations of digital
ledger technologies to create unique and memorable user experiences.

### ZeroDown

##### Transforming home ownership

<div className='w-full flex justify-center items-center'>

![intrinsic.640px.340px](/images/resume/zerodown.jpg)

</div>

In 2019 I decided to start a consulting business. My first contract was with
[ZeroDown](https://zerodown.com), an innovative real estate platform based out
of San Francisco. The founders had just completed raising a Series A after going
through YCombinator's W19 batch. ZeroDown's mission
["to create a new path to homeownership"](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/zero-down/)
felt personal as homeownership always felt out of reach in cities like Vancouver
and San Francisco.

ZeroDown is driven by the radical idea that professionals with steady jobs and
healthy finances should be able to afford homes - even in San Francisco. Thir
unique model offers an alternative to the rent-or-own dilemma, giving users the
benefits of homeownership with the flexibility of renting.

  allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture'
  allowFullScreen
></iframe>

I worked with the engineering and product teams to rebuild zerodown.com. I
planned and implemented a phased transition to a modern component-based
architecture to increase site performance and engineering productivity. I also
helped launch the
[Quantitative Home Buying Guide for San Francisco](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/quantitative-home-buying-guide-bay-area),
which used data to help homebuyers find their ideal neighborhood.

I implemented best practices to enhance web performance, SEO, social presence. I
also evaluated and integrated various 3rd-party offerings to enrich user data,
enahnce analytical insights and streamline sales processes. I collaborated with
the marketing and product team to conduct experiments and drive decisions for
new products and campaigns. At ZeroDown I learned how data transparency can
transform decision making for individuals and build an organization's
reputation.
