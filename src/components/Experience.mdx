Appcubator is the easiest way to prototype. It's goal is to allow non-technical
founders to create and deploy working MVPs using a simple drag-n-drop interface.
Unlike other no-code / low-code solutions at the time, we allowed users to
export fully readably code and continue developing their apps with their own
developers.

In 2012, I was invited by my friends Karan Sikka and Ilter Canberk to join their
startup as a founding engineer. Appcubator had just participated in the
[YC W13](https://www.ycdb.co/company/appcubator) batch and was one of the
earliest low-code solutions to hit the market. My job was to develop the plugin
editor our team used to create and integrate functionality into applications.
This allowed our users quickly extend their app with 3rd party integrations and
common recipes.

After a magnificent journey our team decided to phase out operations and
[open-source our code](https://github.com/appcubator/appbuild) in 2014. Working
on Appcubator was one of the most formative experiences of my career. With
Appcubator, I learned how to work with clients, ship on tight deadlines and made
the difficult tradeoffs between cost, speed and quality critical to business
operations.

Street Jumper is a hyperlocal delivery startup based in Jaipur, Rajasthan.
Between 2014 and 2016, we offered a point-to-point delivery service in the city
In 2014, my classmate Tarin asked me join his company Street Jumper to help him
build out and enhance the technology behind the platform. Over a period of one
year, I worked with our team of engineers and designers to develop and enhance
web, iOS and Android applications for users and delivery partners. At our peak,
we employed 50 delivery partners and processed 250-300 orders per day. In 2016,
Street Jumper was
[acquired by Mumbai based investor and entrepreneur Sandip Modi.](https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:AjJa8-lD5WQJ:https://www.dealstreetasia.com/stories/38842-38842/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us)

Building Street Jumper was a foundational experience for me and I'm extremely
thankful to my co-founder, Tarin. I learned how a focus on privacy and security
can transform an operations-intensive user experience. I also gained experience
in a highly competitive Indian market.

</div>

As part of the Advanced Technology and Growth Team at Zynga, one of my jobs was
to build games and core tech for emerging platforms. At the time, Apple had just
[released Apps for iMessage](https://9to5mac.com/2016/09/12/disney-imessage-app-store-stickers-ios-10/)
and Facebook was in the process of
[launching Instant Games](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/messenger-instant-games/).
With over 65% of users' mobile time spent in messaging apps, it was the perfect
opportunity to inject fun into everyday conversations for our players.

</div>

Throughout 2016, I build client libraries and APIs that were used in over 8
Zynga games. I also integrated Messenger APIs into Zynga's launch titles for
Instant Games allowing our designers and PMs to easily send rich texts over
Messenger to reactivate our players. During this time, I gained invaluable
experience in database operation, systems design and product management from an
engineer's perspective.

In 2018 I joined the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh as lead developer for the
Innovation Studio. Having secured a USD 150,000
[grant from the Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org/articles/museums-technology-new-avenues-for-wonder/),
our goal was to create a chatbot that museum guests could engage with inside and
outside the museum. We partnered with Advancement and Community Engagement (ACE)
team to digitize their existing Summer Adventure program and open it up for all
our visitors. You can read more about CarnegieBot in this
[blog post](https://studio.carnegiemuseums.org/a-chatbot-adventure-c729812571ea).

</div>

Over the next 8 months we developed an
[open-source Messenger chatbot](https://github.com/achadha235/andybot-botpress)
that allowed users to engage in digital activities across all 4 of our museum
properties. Through the program, we discovered the chatbot dramatically
increased membership signup, engagement and retention. In May 2018, we
[presented our findings at the American Alliance of Museums](https://www.aam-us.org/2018/04/10/chat-with-andybot-at-aam-2018/)
