In 2012, I was invited by my friends Karan Sikka and Ilter Canberk to join their
startup as a founding engineer. Appcubator had just participated in the
[YC W13](https://www.ycdb.co/company/appcubator) batch and was one of the
earliest low-code solutions to hit the market. Our goal was to create "the
easiest way to prototype" and allow non-technical founders to create and deploy
working MVPs using a simple drag-n-drop interface. Unlike other no-code /
low-code solutions at the time, we allowed users to export fully readably code
and continue developing their apps with their own developers.

My job was to develop the plugin editor our team used to create and integrate
functionality into applications. This allowed our users quickly extend their app
with 3rd party integrations and common recipes.

After struggling for a year to find product-market fit, our team decided to
phase out operations and open-source our code in 2014. Working on Appcubator was
one of the most formative experiences of my career. With Appcubator, I learnt
how to work clients, work on tight deadlines, made difficult tradeoffs and
visited San Francisco for the very first time..
