In November 2017, Dapper Labs launched CryptoKitties, the first breedable crypto-collectible token. Within days, it exploded in popularity and had become the most used Ethereum smart contract. As an early investor in Ethereum, I became fascinated with non-fungible tokens for gaming. After some reverse-engineering, the exciting opportuinities for innovation became apparant.

I ran into a few like-minded friends on Discord. We decided it would be fun to build decentralized experiences on top of CryptoKitties. In February 2018 launched KittyHats, the first mod for CryptoKitties. We created the first composable tokens that could be used extend the utility of CryptoKitties. It allowed CryptoKitty owners to dress up and accessorize their CryptoKitties. We modeled our marketplace after the hugely popular Steam marketplace for CS:GO skins and decals.

Soon, players began buying our accessories. We noticed that cats dressed in our accessories had higher sale prices than similar "naked" counterparts - this set off a chain reaction. We facilitated several productive collaborations including one with the Seattle Children's hospital where we [raised over 21 ETH for the Seattle Children's Hospital](https://medium.com/cryptokitties/seattle-childrens-hospital-raises-21-6-eth-through-kitties-for-a-cause-a0224c9c4726). Eventually, the [Dapper Labs team took notice](https://medium.com/cryptokitties/welcome-to-the-kittyverse-kittybattles-and-kittyhats-9e83bb1ded88) and KittyHats was acquired.

I moved to Vancouver, BC and joined Dapper Labs. During my time there, I worked on shipping new features and running live ops for CryptoKitties. I also worked with game designers, product managers, designers and engineers to create new crypto collectibles like [Cheeze Wizards](https://medium.com/dapperlabs/cheeze-wizards-the-worlds-first-blockchain-battle-royale-with-cheese-756ec102f9ab),
[NBA Top Shot](https://www.nbatopshot.com/) and others. I also collaborated with other teams to help design Flow, a safe resource-oriented programming language for smart contracts.

Through my work at Dapper Labs, I learned how to read and write smart contracts. I also learned how to leverage the strengths and limitations of digital ledger technologies to create unique and memorable user experiences. I discovered first hand how [incentives can or break multiplayer games](https://spectrum.ieee.org/cryptokitties). Most importantly, I made many friends and learned how to work with a team to ship products that people love.
