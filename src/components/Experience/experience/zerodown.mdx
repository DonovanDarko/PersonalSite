In 2019 I decided to start my own consulting business. My first contract was with [ZeroDown](https://zerodown.com), an innovative real estate platform based out of San Francisco. The founders had just completed raising a Series A after attending YC's W19 batch. ZeroDown's mission ["to create a new path to homeownership"](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/11/zero-down/) felt personal as homeownership always felt out of reach in west-coast metros like Vancouver and San Francisco.

ZeroDown is driven by the radical idea that professionals with steady jobs and healthy finances should be able to afford homes - even in San Francisco. Their unique model offers an alternative to the rent-or-own dilemma, giving users the benefits of homeownership with the flexibility of renting by allowing users the option to build equity in their home over time and work their way up to a down payment.

We first progressively rebuilt [zerodown.com](https://zerodown.com) to improve performance and engineering productivity by using server-side rendering and a modern component-based architecture. I also helped launch various growth and product initiatives to help homebuyers find their ideal neighborhood, the right home and a suitable financing plan with ZeroDown.

Throughout my work, I collaborated closely with the founders, engineering, marketing and sales teams to help bring a better user experience to life. I worked closely with the sales team to integrate various 3rd-party offerings like Okta Identity, Outreach, Autopilot etc. to enrich user data and streamline sales processes. I collaborated with the marketing and product team to conduct rapidly conduct experiments and drive decisions for new product initiatives and campaigns.

At ZeroDown I learned how data transparency can transform decision making for individuals and build an organization's
reputation. I also got first hand experience with the challenges of building a product in a highly regulated space that requires close collaboration with multiple stakeholders like real estate agents, lenders, title companies, etc. Most importantly, I was able to work with a team of talented and experienced individuals who were driven by a common mission - to help people realize their dream of homeownership in the cities they love.
