#### Analytics Engineering

In 2015 I completed my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University and took a full-time position at Zynga as a Software Engineer. I was assigned to the Analytics team, where I worked on building a scalable analytics platform for Zynga's games called ZTrack. I rebuilt frontend for internal reporting platform which was used across all of Zynga's different studios and game teams. Being a part of the Analytics team, I learned a lot about data warehousing, data pipelines, and data visualization. I also learned how to operate at petabyte scale on live products used by millions in a fast-paced environment.


#### Growth Engineering

After almost 2 years with the analytics team, I moved to the Advanced Technology and Growth Tea. Our goal was to was
to build and launch games for emerging platforms. At the time, Apple had just [released Apps for iMessage](https://9to5mac.com/2016/09/12/disney-imessage-app-store-stickers-ios-10/), and Facebook was [launching Instant Games](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/29/messenger-instant-games/). With over 65% of users' mobile time spent in messaging apps, it was the perfect opportunity to inject fun into our players' everyday conversations.

Throughout 2016, I build client libraries and APIs that were used in over 8 Zynga games. I also integrated Messenger APIs into our Instant Games, allowing our designers and PMs to easily send rich texts to reactivate our players. During this time, I gained invaluable experience in database operation, systems design, and applying product and business thinking to engineering. 

My time at Zynga was unforgetable. I got fulfill my childhood dream of building games. I made lifelong friends and learned from some of the smartest people I've ever met. Most importantly, I learned the following lessons that I apply not just to my work, but to life. 

### Lesson 1: Proven, better, best.

> The "proven, better, new" framework is a product strategy we used at Zynga that is still extremely valuable today. The idea is to start with a *proven* existing solution and focus on making it *better* and add one *new* capability to differentiate it and make it 10 times more valuable. Many PM/designers/Eng (including me) believe in inventing from scratch and resist trying to understand what already works today. While there may be *some* unsolved problems, most problems already have solutions, and the opportunity lies in improving upon them. - **Abishek Viswanathan**

At Zynga, this framework guided product decisions, emphasizing humility, grace, and learning from those who went before you. It advocates continuous improvement and the pursuit of excellence, regardless of one's current position.


### Lesson 2: What will our players thank us for?

This question was central to every meeting, reflecting our commitment to creating games that brought joy to people's lives. It also served as a subtle reminder to avoid the [False Consensus Effect](https://biasedbydesign.com/principles/you-are-not-the-user/), ensuring that the players' interests were always at the forefront.

### Lesson 3: Build, measure, learn

> If you can’t measure something, don’t build it. If you couldn’t measure the results, don’t try it. Because how do you know it’s working? How do you know it isn’t?

Data was Zynga's life blood. Building things based on "gut feelings" without data to back up your arguments was frowned upon. Every decision was backed by data and every feature was A/B tested. This was a great lesson in building products that I apply to this day.
