# **Appcubator**

### Low-code web app builder
<ArticleTags tags={metadata.stack}/>


In 2012, my friends Karan Sikka and Ilter Canberk co-founded Appcubator and participated in the [YC W13](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/appcubator) batch. They invited me to join their team as a founding engineer. The PaaS revolution was accelerating swiftly and Appcubator was one of the earliest low-code solutions to hit the market. I was tasked with developing the plugin ecosystem that would enable users to quickly integrate commonly used functionality into Appcubator applications. I also partnered 1-on-1 with clients to help them build apps using our platform.

After a magnificent journey, our team decided to phase out operations and [open-source our code](https://github.com/appcubator/appbuild) in 2014. Working on Appcubator was one of the most formative experiences of my career. I learned how to work with clients, ship on tight deadlines, and make the difficult tradeoffs between cost, speed, and quality critical in a business environment. We also learned how a focused product that target a clearly defined user segment are critical to success.
