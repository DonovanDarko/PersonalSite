The [ChemCollective digital library](http://www.chemcollective.org/) is a collection of virtual lab learning activities for highschool and undergraduate chemistry students. The Virutal Lab was developed by Professor David Yaron at Mellon Institute of Science, Carnegie Mellon University.

In 2012, I joined Professor Yaron's team as a developer. My challenge was to modernize the platform, transitioning from Java and Flash to HTML5 and Javascript. Over two years, we successfully updated over 20 virtual labs and simulations, enhancing accessibility and user experience. These labs are still widely used by educators and students globally. Experience some of these interactive chemistry experiments here. During the pandemic, the Virtual Lab was a critical resource for remote learning.

This project was one of my initial steps into web development. It taught me valuable skills in technology adaptation and problem-solving. I'm proud of its lasting impact and my role in making complex concepts more accessible to learners worldwide.
