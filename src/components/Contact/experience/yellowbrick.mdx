In 2019 the meme stock revolution was well under way and the Internet was abound with misinformation and pump-and-dump scams. I was disappointed with the lack of a verified source of information for stock traders. Serendipitously, a couple of my friends from Zynga, Mark and Connor, had just raised raised a seed round to build Yellowbrick from some great investors (Night Media, Anish Acharaya, Ben Carlson and others). I was just wrapping up with some consulting work and the stars aligned. We knew given our past experience, we could team up to make something really special. I joined the Yellowbrick the first, founding engineer.

Over the next 2 years we built a social platform for stock traders that connected securely to their brokerage accounts. I was responsible for the entire tech stack and built the web app, data pipeline and backend. I also built the infrastructure and data pipeline to ingest and process trades in realtime. We also launched many AI and data intensive growth projects like CEOWatcher and the Yellowbrick Road Newsletter.

At Yellowbrick, I learned a lot about the stock market and the challenges of building a social platform for traders. I also learned a lot about the importance of owning mission-critical parts of your stack, and how critical data quality and liveness are to fintech applications. Finally, we found how important UX can be and how important it is to win user trust in fintech.

Although we had a core of highly engaged users, we ultimately discovered that social factors were not a major motivator for mostretail investors made decisions. Since we were not able to find the product-market fit we'd initially hoped for, Yellowbrick transitioned away from their social platform and pivoted to a premium AI-powered newsletter.
