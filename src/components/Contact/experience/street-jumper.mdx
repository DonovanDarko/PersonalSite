# **Street Jumper**

### Hyperlocal delivery service
<ArticleTags tags={metadata.stack}/>

Street Jumper was a hyperlocal delivery startup based in Jaipur, Rajasthan. Between 2014 and 2016, we offered a point-to-point delivery service in the city, similar to Postmates. The company was founded by my friend Tarin in 2013. I joined him in late 2014 as a technical co-founder and worked with a team of engineers to develop the platform and user experience. At our peak, we employed 52 delivery partners and processed ~320 orders per day. In 2016, the company was [acquired by Mumbai based investor and entrepreneur Sandip Modi.](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/121593-88#overview). 

Building Street Jumper was a foundational experience for me and I'm incredibly thankful to my co-founder, Tarin. I learned how preserving users' privacy and security is critical not just for UX but also for a company's reputation and survival. We also learned how to manage human resources and unit economics while running an operations intensive business. We got to meet some incredible entrepreneurs along the way including Kunal Bahl, founder of Snapdeal and Mohandas Pai former CFO of Infosys.
