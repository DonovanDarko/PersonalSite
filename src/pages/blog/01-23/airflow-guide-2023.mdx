#### Summary

Apache Airflow is popular workflow management system for creating data
pipelines. It can be extremely useful for creating and running complex data
processes at scale. In this guide, you will learn how to:

- Learn about Airflow and when to use it
- Set up a local Airflow 2.2 dev environment using Docker
- Author a basic data Airflow DAG using the Taskflow API to perform operations on a Postgres database and Google Clound.
- Write unit and integration tests for your code
- Learn about options to run Airflow in production

When to useÂ Airflow Airflow does a few things very well. Provides a clean and
powerful API to author complex data pipelines Runs a distributed, fault-tolerant
system of workers and schedulers to run your tasks scalable Efficiently pools
and manages common resources like workers, database connections, etc. Provides a
robust and well designed web UI and CLI for configuration and operations

When to choose Airflow You already know Python well You need horizontal
scalability You want to be able to set resource allocation limits with great
granularity Your workflow is a complex, multi-stage You need complex logic
around backfilling / retrying / rescheduling jobs Your workflow long-running
operation You want a full-fledged, production ready job management UI

When not to choose Airflow You are on a tight(er) budget You don't already know
Python Your workflow is relatively simple or short lived You will only run a few
jobs in parallel You don't need complex resource / concurrency management

Key Concepts DAGS and Tasks All Airflow workflows are represented as a set of
Tasks arranged in a DAG.Â  A task is the fundamental unit of execution within
Airflow. Essentially, it is a special piece of codeâ€Š-â€Šusually Pythonâ€Š-â€Šthat can
be run within Airflow. Multiple tasks can be arranged into a DAG to create a
full, multi-step workflow definition. You can configure each task independently
and define it's behaviour. For exampleâ€Š-â€Šyou can tell Airflow that the
"send_error_alert" task that is skipped if all previous tasks completed
successfully and should only trigger if one of the upstream tasks failed.Â  DAGs
and Tasks have their own unique ID that can be used to reference the object.
These are used to create a "directed acylical graph" that defines the entirety
of the workflow.Â  ðŸ’¡TIP: Airflow distributes tasks across multiple machines. In
a large production environment with multiple workers, there is no garuntee that
any 2 tasks will be run by the same worker. This means you should keep your
tasks encapsulated and not rely on local file or memory storage within your
workflows. DAG Run When you want to execute your workflow, you create a "DAG
run" by providing the ID of the DAG you want to run, along with any arguments
you'd like to pass. The scheduler then creates and queues up your new DAG run
which executes when a worker becomes available. Triggers A trigger is an event
that causes a DAG run. There are two important types of triggers - Manualâ€Š-â€Šwhen
Airflow is trigged using the API, CLI or Web UI manually Scheduledâ€Š-â€Šthe Airflow
triggers the DAG based on a pre-defined schedule. In the UI, these are indicated
by little circles around the DAG
