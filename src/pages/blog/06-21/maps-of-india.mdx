Recently, my great aunt passed after 98 years of a full and happy life. After
performing her final rites, my mother and I decided to clean up her apartment.
The apartment itself was small but stuffed to the brim with approximately 70
years worth of things. It seems as they age, people become increasingly
reluctant to part with their material belongings opting to keep rusty pins,
broken plastic containers, pens that don't work for sentimental reasons.
