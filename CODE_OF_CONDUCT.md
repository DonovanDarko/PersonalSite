## Reasonable Person Principle

Reasonable Person Principle:

- Everyone will be reasonable.
- Everyone expects everyone else to be reasonable.
- No one is special.
- Do not be offended if someone suggests you are not being reasonable.

As a simple guideline we ask that you use the Reasonable Person Principle. The reasonable person principle holds that reasonable people strike a suitable balance between their own immediate desires and the good of the community at large. It is a principle that asks us to consider the needs of others and to act in a way that is respectful and considerate of those needs. It is a principle that asks us to consider the needs of others and to act in a way that is respectful and considerate of those needs. Not all people share the same model of reasonableness, so disagreements inevitably occur. Under the reasonable person principle, the first thing to do is work it out privately (perhaps in person, since e-mail is known to amplify feelings). Indeed, many people would find it unreasonable to bring in third parties before trying personal discussion.

More generally, the reasonable person principle favors local, unofficial actions over formal administrative ones. It assumes that people will be responsive when reminded of a conflict or asked to re-examine their behavior. It encourages requesting rather than demanding. And it leaves some room for difference of opinion.
